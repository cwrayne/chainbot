# ChainBot
Discord bot that plays a game where you *chain* letters/words together to make a sentence.

## Invite

Invite the bot [here (https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1343609177028694076)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1343609177028694076).
Then run c!help to see the commands!

## Use your own bot
In case you wanted to use your own bot instead of the bot that I have made, follow these instructions:
1. `git clone` the repo and `cd` into it
2. Install python if you haven't already, and then run `pip install discord.py` to install `discord.py`.
3. Edit bot.py and edit the `TOKEN` variable at the end of the file to your bot's token.
4. Finally, run the bot and run `c!help` on the server that has your bot.
